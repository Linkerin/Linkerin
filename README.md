### About me <a id="about"></a>

Long story short, I am a **web developer** from Moldova ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡© residing in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½
who is fond of gym, travelling and learning _espaÃ±ol_. If you are interested,
then a bit more about me.

I believe that creating useful and powerful applications is not just about
routine tasks and technical knowledge but also involves a creative attitude,
inspiration and real passion. These ideas are reflected in my current side
project [**Limba Vie**](https://limba.ravenplan.com). It's a mobile web
application designed to help users learn Romanian words through fun and colorful
flashcards.

### Technology stack <a id="technologies"></a>

I am highly fascinated by the world of programming and development nowadays.  
Below are some of the technologies I usually use:

Besides the role of a developer, I also have a solid background as a **project
manager**. During the past 5 years, I've participated in the development of
several enterprise products in the banking sphere using agile methodologies.  
At the same time working as a **financial risk manager** made me understand that
in our constantly evolving world the synergy of financials and technology is
extremely powerful. Thus, I am trying to combine knowledge of both in my
professional growth.

I make every effort to obtain high-quality knowledge:
